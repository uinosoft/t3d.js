/**
 * A standard physically based material, using Metallic-Roughness workflow.
 * Physically based rendering (PBR) has recently become the standard in many 3D applications, such as Unity, Unreal and 3D Studio Max.
 * This approach differs from older approaches in that instead of using approximations for the way in which light interacts with a surface, a physically correct model is used.
 * The idea is that, instead of tweaking materials to look good under specific lighting, a material can	be created that will react 'correctly' under all lighting scenarios.
